    "Now there is just one `pending` executed. The loop code which creates a waker and call `.poll` until it finishes is called an executor, and the code inside sleep future which creates a thread and calls `.wake` is a reactor (a super stupid one). Since Rust is a no runtime language (unlike for example JS) writing these is on the shoulder of user. There are many third party libraries which provide executor and reactors for common things like timers and networking and IO. Some executors are for embedded systems, some are for writing OS, and ..., and there are multiple competeing executors for running in normal computers, which in them `tokio` is the more popular one."

    "This was a basic taste of async in Rust, and was no where near complete. There are other great resources to learn async in Rust. The goal of this chapter was to only make you familiar with this existence of this feature in Rust, which doesn't exists in C, and it is only added in C++20 (in Rust, tokio and futures was there from 2016 and async await syntax was added in 2018). The one in C++ is similar, but different. Both use generators to lower the async blocks, but C++ exposes the coroutine to the user unlike Rust, which coroutine and generators are just implementation details. C++ adds implicit allocations, so it's async await is not useful for embedded and similar which allocation is not available. Also, being older, and with a sane package manager, Rust has richer async ecosystem.\n",

    "Rust doesn't have executor and reactors in the standard library, and it's a good thing, because there is no one-size-fit-all executor. A tiny embedded executor is not desired for a multi core server, and vise versa. But this causes interoperability problems. A library which uses `tokio::time::sleep` is incompatible with one using `embassy_executor::time::block_for` which is the same function for `embassy`, an embedded executor, even if it just sleeps and doesn't require any other functionality. There are async libraries which are executor independent, with having their own reactor. But they are either for a specific propose, or are not as performant as executor dependent libraries (like our timer, which was executor independent, but extremely wasteful by running one thread per sleep call). This can be partially solved by async trait and functions which are generic over executor."
